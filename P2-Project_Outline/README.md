## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I want to create a Meal Planner app that would include a shopping list, and nutritional information. With my app you can plan your meals ahead of time in order to make healthy choices. There will no longer be the headache of thinking what to make. No more endless trips to the grocery store. It will also cut down on food waste because you will be buying ingredients based on a plan.  
### Features
User Login : Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.

Add Recipies : Users can get recipes from online sources, or create their own. Users will also be able to select from past recipes their have already entered.

Weekly View : Users will be able to select meals for the week. This will be an overview of the meals planned that week. 

Shopping list: That weeks list of ingredients will be shown in a printable and organized shopping list. 

Pantry : Users will be able to view a pantry list based on the items in the shopping list. In order for food not to go to waste.

Nutrional Information : In the weekly view the recipies selected will have the weekly and daily nutrional information such as calories (if the information is present for that recipe).

Saved Plans : A view of past shopping list created will be appear in the user's profile. This will save time if the user just want to reuse a list.
### Technologies
C# 
ASP.Net
MySQL
Calendar API
BigOven API

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to download/save recipies from different websites based on the information I need. BigOven provides a great resource for third party websites to access 500,000+ recipes and their related data. So, learn how to use that API. I would also like to include the recipes on a calender (maybe google). Also learn how to visually show data, for example graphs in my application.
